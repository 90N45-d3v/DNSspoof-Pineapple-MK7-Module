This module gives you the possibility to quickly manipulate DNS records and forge domains to IP addresses of your choice

*As soon as my pull request is accepted, this module will be available in [Hak5's official module repository](https://github.com/hak5/pineapple-modules) and should be available for download directly from the web interface of the WiFi Pineapple.*
